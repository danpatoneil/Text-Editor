  ## Installation
  This application is hosted [live on Render](https://jate-by-dan-oneil.onrender.com/). Users will not have to do any installation other than going to the website linked and start typing. To launch this site as a PWA, simply click the install button to open it on your computer as a separate app. Where exactly this new offline version of the app is stored will depend on the user, but your browser will usually have a folder where it can be accessed within its files.

  ## Usage
  This application is a simple Javascript text editor. Users can type text in it and it will save it to a local database on their computer, saving their text for later use. This database is unique to each user so you won't have to worry about other users getting access to your text.

  ## How to Contribute
  Users that seek to contribute can simply fork and use as they please, or if they seek to contribute further to the model itself here are some reasonable areas of improvement. Adding functionality with multiple tabs is very feasible, it would requrie a slight re-work of how the database works and would obviously necessitate changes to the editor page itself. The service worker might have some cause to be updated, it is fairly basic as it is and adding a time limit on cacheing might be worthwhile. Allowing the user to change the format of codemirror, maybe even on a tab by tab basis if the previous improvement has been made, is very feasible and would allow this text editor to be used by users that produce code in a language other than Javascript. Another improvement would be allowing the user to decide where exactly the offline version of the PWA is stored on their computer. For advanced users that are able to determine the download location of such apps it might not be an issue, but for the general user that is not familiar with PWA apps, finding them after the initial download might be a challenge.
